# Airbnb Analysis

The goal of this analysis was to find out how many reviews people left reviews on properties similar to my house by month of the year and on average. The assumption is that ~80% of the guests leave reviews, meaning I can scale up the number of reviews by 1.25 to get the total number of guests on average. Using that and the median price for similar listings, we can get an estimate of the revenue generated by my house.
